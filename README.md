# PyBer Analysis

## Purpose
The below analysis has been prepared to analyse the ride data from the first half (January -May) of 2019. The analysis displays this data by breaking it down by city type (urban, rural, and suburban), and further summarizes it by week for the period of Jan-April 2019. This data shows different information by city type which can be used by the executives at PyBer when making decisions such as prices to charge, income drivers can expect, and demographics of which cities use the driver services more.
## Results
The below image shows the ride data from January 2019 to May 2019

#### Total Rides
Urban locations have by far the greatest number of total rides at 1,625- the next highest is suburban with 625. This also shows that rural locations have the least number of rides. This is consistent with demographics as individuals living in rural areas or even some in the suburbs likely have their own means of transportation (cars).
 #### Total Drivers
Urban makes up the greatest number of total drivers with 2,405- this is almost 5x as many drivers that appear in suburban areas. This follows the same trend as the Total Rides analysis above, where there are less rides there are less drivers. The lesser number of drivers can also explain the lesser number of rides- as these would positively correlate with supply and demand.
 #### Total Fares
Total fares follow the same trend with urban fares overall being highest and rural as lowest. This is not indicative of the amount per ride (see next section) as this is a total, meaning that because urban areas have the greatest number of drivers and rides, urban areas would also contribute the highest total fares.
 #### Average Fare Per Ride
Rural areas have the highest fare per ride where urban have the lowest. Urban areas would have a higher likelihood of having destinations closer together than a rural area tying in why the cost of a ride in an urban area would be the least expensive.
 #### Average Fare Per Driver
Drivers in rural areas make significantly more then urban drivers do (more than 3x) per ride. This can be accounted for by the higher fares per trip than urban and the lesser number of drivers in rural areas. Each trip brings in more fares and there are fewer drivers to allocate them by.
 #### Total Fare by City Type
The below graph shows similarities in trend line across all the city types. This means that consumers in the areas follow similar “peak” and “valley” usage points where particular weeks are more popular to use PyBer, like with the end of February.

 ## Summary
Based on the above discussion, recommendations for PyBer are:
 1. PyBer should work to increase the number of drivers in rural areas to make it more accessible to increase the number of rides. This will in turn lessen the average fare per trip as the drivers would be closer to their customers for pickup therefore making the distance travelled less.
 2. PyBer should increase their marketing within urban areas showing the low fares that are available and fast arrival times (given the increase in drivers). Urban areas are their highest earning space with the highest number of drivers available to handle the increased demand.
 3. Week over week there is a consistent bump in fares across all channels in the end of February. PyBer should review this data for the entire year to see where seasonality bumps occur and time sales within those to capitalize more on increased ridership to gain more riders and more revenue.
